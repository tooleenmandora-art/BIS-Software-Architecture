# Brokerage Information System (BIS)
Software Architecture Project

##  Project Overview
This project presents the architectural design of a Brokerage Information System (BIS) that integrates multiple legacy systems into a centralized platform.  
The system focuses on scalability, security, performance, and interoperability.

## 🏗 Architectural Approach
The system architecture was designed based on:

- Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs)
- Utility Tree Analysis
- Quality Attribute Prioritization
- Publisher-Subscriber Architectural Pattern
- Messaging Infrastructure Design

##  System Integration
The BIS integrates data from:

- CPS (Commercial Property System)
- RPS (Residential Property System)
- BBS (Billing & Contract System)

##  Quality Attributes Addressed
- Performance (≤ 2 seconds report generation under peak load)
- Security (Secure authentication and authorization)
- Availability (99.9% uptime)
- Interoperability (Legacy system integration)
- Modifiability (Support future system expansion)

##  Architectural Pattern
Publisher-Subscriber Pattern with a Message Broker to enable asynchronous communication and loose coupling between systems.

##  Project Artifacts
- Use Case Diagram
- Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs)
- Utility Tree
- Quality Attribute Analysis
- Messaging Infrastructure Design
- Presentation & Final Report
